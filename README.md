# TensorFlow Transfer Learning with VGG19 and XAI 🧠🔍

Welcome to the deep learning project, where the focus is on leveraging the power of transfer learning using the VGG19 network within TensorFlow to tackle the specific problem of image classification.

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of transfer learning for image classification by fine-tuning the VGG19 model, a pre-trained deep learning model on the ImageNet dataset. The fine-tuned version of the network can be seen by using VisualKeras and Netron libraries, as displayed in the project code. Besides the classification problem, Explainable AI (XAI) methods are implemented to ensure transparency and interpretability of the model's decisions.

### 🛠 Technologies Used
